I spent most of 2014 to 2016 in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, USA.  I initially lived in Mountain View, before moving to the Redwood City/San Carlos area.  I worked at <a href="http://www.icracked.com">iCracked</a> on Ocean, an experimental hardware project.  Prior to this, I was co-founder of a company called SocialBox.
