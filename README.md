# My Personal Website

This is the public source code to my personal website, www.davidpetrie.com.

This is a gatsby.js project.


# Project Data Structure

I want to have a list of projects on the site.  Each project has the following data:

- Name
- Description (as markdown)
- Date started
- Date active
- Links:
    - Github
    - Twitter
    - Medium posts
- Images:
    - Thumbnails
- Videos

Each project can have a couple of different views, such as summary view, gallery view, page view, and so forth.

Is there a service out there that can provide all of this, together with an API so I can display the projects on my own website?

(I've only googled for five minutes but can't find anything obvious.)
