# About Me

My name is David Petrie and I live and work in Wellington, New Zealand.  I am primarily a software engineer who happens to get involved in startups from time to time.

Currently, I am founder of DreamEngine.  DreamEngine is a marketplace for selling software automation tools, starting with graphic design tools.  My general hypothesis is that we're on the cusp of being able to build highly advanced software automation tools that are far more powerful than the anything currently available.

# Career Highlights

Prior to DreamEngine, in descending chronological order:

* I worked on a VR app called [Vast](http://www.vastvr.com), a tool for crafting 3D objects and environments directly in VR. 

* From 2013 to 2016 I spent most of my time in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, USA.  I worked at [iCracked](https://www.icracked.com), leading a small team of elite programmers and engineers to create [Ocean](https://getocean.now.sh/), a hardware product.

* Related to this, in 2015 I published my [first US patent](https://www.google.co.nz/patents/WO2016019236A1).

* In 2013, I got into [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com) for the Winter 2014 batch, as co-founder of SocialBox (renamed Shopagram).

* Between 2010 and 2013, I was co-founder and CTO of [PlayCoMo](http://www.playcomo.com), making mobile phone games.  I ran the company's office out of Wellington, New Zealand, managing our staff in five different countries (USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Indonesia).  We shipped a lot of games for both iOS and Android, and got millions of downloads.  Here's a gallery.

* After a trip to Silicon Valley in 2008 I came back with an iPhone, and decided to on make mobile apps.  I began making indie mobile phone games under the moniker [@hackdirt](https://twitter.com/hackdirt/). Here's a gallery of games I made.

* I also built iOS apps for various companies in New Zealand, Australia, and the UK (including Subway NZ, Pizza Hut, Wagamama, and Royal Bank of Scotland).

* In 2007 I became lead developer at awesome education software startup [Arlo](https://www.arlo.co). Arlo powers a training platform for a impressive number of schools and companies in New Zealand and around the world, such as Xero, Microsoft, and the University of Auckland.

* From 2003 to 2007 I got into enterprise software.  I wrote financial modelling software and business applications for various companies in New Zealand, including PayGlobal ([now acquired by MYOB](https://www.myob.com/nz/enterprise/software-systems/payglobal)). I did a big consulting project for [Progressive Enterprises](http://www.progressive.co.nz), to power analytics for all their supermarkets in New Zealand. 

* In 2002 I started an online DVD store called [Moviehouse](/archive/mh/mhNewScreen.png) which I later sold.

* To fund my beer and gadget expenses at University I started a webdesign studio, as well as a tutoring company called [UniTutor](/archive/unitutor/main30.gif).

* In my first year of university, right after the dotcom crash in 2000, I started a website called "Daily Business Review".  It was like ["Arts and Letters Daily"](http://www.aldaily.com), but for tech news.  For whatever reason, it attracted a lot of cease-and-desist letters. [Here's an archive!](/archive/dbr/index.html)
