								<article class="box post">
<p>
I mainly live and work in Wellington, New Zealand.  I am currently working on Human Apps, building automation tools.
</p>
<p>
I also work on a project called <a href="http://www.vastvr.com">Vast</a>. Vast is a tool for crafting 3D objects and environments directly in VR.
</p>
<p>
I spent most of 2014 to 2016 in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, USA.  I initially lived in Mountain View, before moving to the Redwood City/San Carlos area.  I worked at <a href="http://www.icracked.com">iCracked</a> on Ocean, a hardware project.  Prior to this, I was co-founder of a company called SocialBox.  We got funded by <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> for the W14 batch.</p>
<p>
Between 2010 and 2013, I was co-founder and CTO of <a href="http://www.playcomo.com">PlayCoMo</a>, a company that makes mobile phone games.  I ran the company's office out of Wellington, New Zealand, managing our staff in five different countries (USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Indonesia).
</p>
<p>
Before PlayCoMo I made indie mobile phone games under the moniker <a href="https://twitter.com/hackdirt/">@hackdirt</a>. I also built iOS apps for various companies in New Zealand, Australia, and the UK (including Subway NZ, Pizza Hut, Wagamama, and Royal Bank of Scotland).
</p>
<p>
From 2007 to 2008 I was lead developer at awesome education software startup <a href="https://www.arlo.co">Arlo</a>. Arlo powers a training platform for a growing number of schools and companies in New Zealand and Australia, such as <a href="http://events.xero.com">Xero</a>, Microsoft, and the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>
From 2004 to 2007 I wrote enterprise software (mostly financial modelling software and business applications) for various companies in New Zealand.
