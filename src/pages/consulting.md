## Interim CTO or Technical Product Manager

I am most useful when I'm in the role of **Interim CTO** or **Technical Product Manager**, where I am building a new product from scratch in an unexplored or growing market.  This work generally entails a combination of following jobs:

* Deciding what product to build, based on a hypothesis or narrative from the founding team.

* Deciding how to build the product.  This involves deciding what programming languages to use, determining initial infrastructure requirements, researching APIs and open source libraries, and so forth.

* Designing and developing an initial software prototype.  Depending on the budget, I may do this work myself, or hire a team to do it.

* Shipping the product without being crippled by overwhelming [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt).

* Processing feedback from customers, and then building new features based on this feedback.

* Figuring out post-release solutions for maintenance, testing, outage management, monitoring, security, analytics, and so forth.

## Full Stack Software Engineering (Web and Mobile)

I can do full stack software engineering, as long as I am supported by a solid product manager or product-focused CEO.  Here are some of the technologies I can work with to build a web application:

* Node JS

* React

* Python

* Postgres, Redis, MongoDB.

* CSS/HTML

* Various build tools like webpack, gulp, jenkins etc.

* AWS EC2, S3, Cloudfront, Lambda, etc.

In addition to this, I have a lot of experience in building apps for mobile phones.  From 2008 to 2014 I more or less worked exclusively on apps for iOS and Android.  As of 2018, I'm a lot more comfortable on iOS than Android.

I've also been developing in C++ for the last decade. Many of these projects are covered on the [projects page](/projects).

## Hiring and Managing Software Teams

I've managed small teams of highly talented engineering professionals, primarily in Silicon Valley and New Zealand.  In all cases, the teams have been a mix of employees, contractors, and vendors, both local and remote.

Most recently at iCracked, I lead the team on the [Ocean project](/project/ocean/) at iCracked's HQ in Redwood City, California.  The project was very complex and had both hardware and software components, and we had to hire accordingly.  I lead the process of hiring local and remote team members and conducted multiple job interviews.  I helped setup a partnership with a local hardware engineering company to perform electical engineering work.  I also managed relationships with external hardware vendors and contractors, who made up the majority of people on the project.  I faciliated regular meetings for all stakeholders in the project.  Finally, I managed the development of all the software for the project, with a small team of - at most - five engineers at iCracked, and two remote contractors.

(People are hard to retain in Silicon Valley, but I am most proud of the fact that core team members who worked on Ocean went on to even greater things at companies like Twilio and Uber)

Prior to this I managed a remote team of software engineers, artists, and testers for three years at PlayCoMo.  Team members were located all over the world: New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, Canada and so on.  The team worked on a large number of games for iOS and Android, shipping multiple titles and getting millions of downloads for each game.  We punched above our weight by shipping more games than was reasonable for our small team (never growing beyond about 20, by my estimation).  We were never in "crunch" mode for any of the projects, and I only remember one self-inflicted all-nighter the entire time I was there.

## Graphical Tools and Libraries with C++ and OpenGL
 
For much of my career I've produced graphical tools and apps.  Some examples:
* [Dream Engine](/project/dream_engine/)
* [GigaDraw](/project/dream_engine/)
* [Algorithmic Design Engine](/project/algorithmic_design_engine/)
* [difont (OpenGL font rendering)](/project/difont/)
* [FTGLES](/project/ftgles/)

### Mobile Phone Game Engines

With so much uncertainty about whether a mobile game will succeed or not, it is probably best to experiment with a tool like Unity first.  However, Unity is a broad brush and has many drawbacks. Many [mobile game companies prefer to use their own engine](https://www.quora.com/What-3D-engine-does-the-Clash-of-Clans-mobile-game-use/answer/Leon-Kitain) because it allows them to completely customise their development process.

I've developer three mobile phone game engines.  My first engine, known as HDK v1, was purely for iOS and has been [open sourced here](https://github.com/cdave1/hdk).  I worked on a second version of this engine that I need to clean up and release on github.  I later worked on the [CDK game engine](/project/cdk_game_engine/).  I worked on this engine for three years, and used in multiple games, for both iOS and Android, with millions of downloads.

## Interesting Fringe Stuff

I've dabbled with the following technologies.  I haven't shipped anything substantial with these technologies (yet), but I know enough that I've moved beyond the beginning tutorials:

* Machine learning, particularly GANs.

* Simulations in virtual environments, particularly when coupled with ML.

* Getting the most out of AWS Lambda (see https://github.com/cdave1/serverless-helloworld).

* Crypto currency stuff: ERC721 contracts (e.g. cryptokitties), and Stellar anchors.

# My Rates

I charge by the month, and a typical contract is for 1 month of work.  I prefer contracts that go for longer than that.  For contracts that are shorter than 1 month, we'll divide my monthly rate by the number of days you want, and add a small amount of overhead.

I require a small deposit - usually no more than a third of the total - before beginning work.

### Working Remote and Travel

I normally work remotely from Wellington, New Zealand.  I primarily work with companies in the United States.  I can travel to your office for meetings on longer term projects.

# Ethics and Disclaimers

### Errors and Bugs

While I will try my best to write software that is 100% error free, I can't guarantee my software will be perfect.  The code I write for you will probably have errors in it.

I prefer to cut a feature entirely than to miss a deadline.  Often it's better to drop a feature that contains errors rather than taking another day to fix the error, if it means a deadline can be reached.  I will discuss these situations with you if a particular error effects a shipping deadline.


### Project Estimates

I will try to provide accurate estimates for how long a particular project will take, but accurate estimation is normally quite difficult on high value work.  To create valuable software, it is necessary to make a lot of unique combinations of decisions about how to solve different problems.  It's the uniqueness of the project that makes estimation hard; software that does not exist has, by definition, never been done before.

Estimates are not the equivalent of deadlines, but they can help set expectations about what can be delivered *by* a deadline.  To meet deadlines, it's usually necessary to "ship early and ship often", so I will often insist that the team I work with meets with me on a frequent basis, preferably weekly, if not more frequently.


### Maintainability

After a lot of software engineering, I am biased toward simplicity.  I am suspicious of solutions that are unnecessarily complex or attempt to re-invent various wheels.  I will make use of labor saving open source libraries where ever possible.


### Software Security Vulnerabilities

I have a very good understanding of the principles of writing secure software.  However, I am not a full time security expert.  In every case that applies, I will use battle-tested software created by full time security and cryptography experts.  I will also write defensive code that deals with all the common attack vectors on web applications, mobile applications, and APIs.

Software today is very reliant on third-party libraries.  Those libraries may contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities, and this may still open your software up to attack in spite of my best efforts.


## What I Won't Do

I have a number of projects I will flat out refuse to work on:

* I will not write software that violates the privacy of users.

* I will not clone an existing software product that has been created by a well known or well-funded competitor.  Cloning is usually never successful (with some [notable exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Internet)), but either way it is boring as hell to work on.

* I won't participate in a project that seeks to do weird proprietary things with open source software.

* I haven't seen a good proposal for a mobile game in a long time, so I generally no longer work on mobile games.  However, I am open to working on genuinely new ideas.

* There's something going on with free mobile apps that optimise user attention and engagement.  I've deleted all such apps from my mobile phone (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc).  I'm very skeptical about the usefulness of these applications.

* I won't work on anything involving an ICO.

Also, I flat out refuse to do any timed coding tests (like codility or hackerrank, and so forth) before starting a job.  These tests are not going to tell you anything you don't already know about me: they only tell me that you don't believe any of the claims made on this site about my ability to complete basic coding tasks.  These tests optimise for programmers who can pass coding tests, not for programmers who can add value to a business.
