# My Rates

A typical contract is for 1 month of work.  I prefer contracts that go for longer than that.

For shorter contracts, we'll divide my monthly rate by the number of days you want, and add a small amount of overhead.

I require a small deposit - usually less than a third of the total - before beginning work.

# Ethics and Disclaimers

While I will try my best to write software that is 100% error free, I can't guarantee my software will be perfect.  The code I write for you will probably have errors in it.

I prefer to err on the side of cutting features to ship work on time.  Often it's better to drop a feature that contains errors rather than taking another day to fix the error, if it means a deadline can be reached.  I will discuss these situations with you if a particular error effects a shipping deadline.


# Estimates

I will try to provide accurate estimates for how long a particular project will take, but accurate estimation is normally quite difficult on high value work.  Software involves a lot of unique combinations of decisions about how to solve a problem.  It's the uniqueness of the project that makes estimation hard; software that does not exist has, by definition, never been done before.

To meet deadlines, it's usually necessary to "ship early and ship often", so I will often insist that the team I work with meets with me on a frequent basis, preferably weekly.


# Maintainability

After a lot of software engineering, I am biased toward simplicity.  I am suspicious of solutions to problems that are unnecessarily complex or attempt to "re-invent the wheel".  I will make use of labor saving open source libraries where ever possible.


# Software Security Vulnerabilities

I have a very good understanding of the principles of writing secure software.  However, I am not a full time security expert.  In every case that applies, I will use battle-tested software created by full time security and cryptography experts.  I will also write defensive code that deals with all the common attack vectors on web applications, mobile applications, and APIs.

Software today is very reliant on third-party libraries.  Those libraries may contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities, and this may still open your software up to attack in spite of my best efforts.


# Travel

I normally work remotely from Wellington, New Zealand.  I primarily work with companies in the United States.  I can travel to your office to discuss 


# What I Won't Do

I have a number of projects I will flat out refuse to work on.

* I will not clone existing software from well known or well-funded companies.  Cloning is usually never successful (with some notable exceptions), but either way it is boring as hell to work on.

* I generally no longer work on mobile games.  I haven't seen a good proposal for a mobile game in a long time.  Maybe yours is different?

* I will not write software that violates the privacy of users.

* I won't participate in a project that seeks to do weird proprietary things with open source software.
