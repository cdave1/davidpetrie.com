                <Header>2018 Reading List</Header>

                <p>My goal for 2018 is to get back to my cadence of roughly one book per week. I have a backlog of books by Vaclav Smil and Carlotta Perez that I want to get through.  After that, I want to read more history and less fiction.  I'm looking forward to reading more of Peter Brown's work: the period of late antiquity is just so damn interesting.</p>

                <Header>2017 Reading List</Header>

                <p>Peter Brown's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Through-Eye-Needle-Christianity-350-550-ebook/dp/B009EYPOCC">"Through the Eye of a Needle"</a> was the highlight of 2017.  However, both the quality and quantity of my reading dipped in 2017 as work took precedence over everything else.   I was a lot more ruthless about abandoning books this year, too, with about 20-30 books being abandoned before I could bother finishing, not counting Kindle samples.  I feel like I've run out of interesting science fiction, apart from one or two of Stanislaw Lem's novels.  I don't follow SF fandoms so I'm not up to date with newer authors.</p>
