# Ethics and Disclaimers

This article specifically relates to work my [consulting work](/consulting/).

### Errors and Bugs

While I will try my best to write software that is 100% error free, I can't guarantee my software will be perfect.  The code I write for you will probably have errors in it.

I prefer to cut a feature entirely than to miss a deadline.  Often it's better to drop a feature that contains errors rather than taking another day to fix the error, if it means a deadline can be reached.  I will discuss these situations with you if a particular error effects a shipping deadline.


### Project Estimates

I will try to provide accurate estimates for how long a particular project will take, but accurate estimation is normally quite difficult on high value work.  To create valuable software, it is necessary to make a lot of unique combinations of decisions about how to solve different problems.  It's the uniqueness of the project that makes estimation hard; software that does not exist has, by definition, never been done before.

Estimates are not the equivalent of deadlines, but they can help set expectations about what can be delivered *by* a deadline.  To meet deadlines, it's usually necessary to "ship early and ship often", so I will often insist that the team I work with meets with me on a frequent basis, preferably weekly, if not more frequently.


### Maintainability

After a lot of software engineering, I am biased toward simplicity.  I am suspicious of solutions that are unnecessarily complex or attempt to re-invent various wheels.  I will make use of labor saving open source libraries where ever possible.


### Software Security Vulnerabilities

I have a very good understanding of the principles of writing secure software.  However, I am not a full time security expert.  In every case that applies, I will use battle-tested software created by full time security and cryptography experts.  I will also write defensive code that deals with all the common attack vectors on web applications, mobile applications, and APIs.

Software today is very reliant on third-party libraries.  Those libraries may contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities, and this may still open your software up to attack in spite of my best efforts.


## What I Won't Do

I have a number of projects I will flat out refuse to work on:

* I will not write software that violates the privacy of users.

* I will not clone an existing software product that has been created by a well known or well-funded competitor.  Cloning is usually never successful (with some [notable exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Internet)), but either way it is boring as hell to work on.

* I won't participate in a project that seeks to do weird proprietary things with open source software written by other people.

* I haven't seen a good proposal for a mobile game in a long time, so I generally no longer work on mobile games.  However, I am open to working on genuinely new ideas.

This is not an exhaustive list!
