Random Thoughts on VR

The VR market has bifurcated into two pretty distinct product categories.  One I'll call "Mobile VR", and the other "PC VR".

"PC VR" devices need a Windows-based PC to work.

positional tracking, and hand tracking peripherals.  Probably going to cost at least $1200 to get a minimal-spec PC and an Oculus Rift.

It's important to realize how transformative positional tracking is

"Mobile VR" is the mobile phone based VR, more or less equivalent to a Viewmaster with a video screen behind it.  The lack of positional tracking means that you never get the feeling of "presence" like you do from "True VR".  You DO get the stereoscopic vision, however, so it's still pretty impressive.


Market Size:



Mobile VR:

Gear VR - 1m
Google Cardboard - 1m

I don't know anything about engagement.  Anecdotally, these are gimicky toys and don't get used that often.  I haven't used my Gear (I have three headsets) for months now.


PC VR

Oculus CV1 - 200k?
HTC Vive - 150k?

Again, I don't have any information on engagement.  Steam allegedly adding 1000 new VR users each week.  Some games companies are on track to do over $1m+ in sales this year.



The long term project of all VR companies is to combine the mobility of Mobile VR with the technology of the PC VR.  Tough problem but probably do-able in the next 2-3 years, if not sooner.  I don't see a large market developing until





Analogies from Older Technology

VR software is like the web in 1993.  You have a browser (the headset) and you can browse a few interesting things (apps) but there's little in-depth stuff to keep you there.  The various platform specific app-stores are there.  Social apps are still being built.

Impossible for non-VR developers to produce any interactive content for VR -- while you can host your app through the Oculus App Store, or Steam, you still need to do a lot of stuff to build the app in the first place.



Staying On Top Of News

I think Reddit is an excellent source of news, and probably the number one source for me.  The following subreddits are active:

/r/oculus
/r/vive
/r/virtualreality

Twitch has a category for virtual reality content:

UploadVR and RoadToVR are the best podcasts.

Hacker News is completely useless for VR information.



Building VR Apps

Unity is where you want to start, since it makes it trivially easy to go from nothing, to having a VR app that runs on all the VR platforms.


Why its worse for startups than you think.

    1. For strategic reasons, the incumbents are hogging all the innovation opportunities in hardware.
    2. Better tools mean that it's really easy for ANYONE to build a VR app.
    3. VR software distribution mechanisms are basically identical to those on mobile phones, so the economics are going to be similar.
    3a. Very difficult for consumers to determine quality from app stores.  Need external sources for this.  Puts pressure on startups: need to advertise, PR, etc.
    4. Most early adopters are gamers, and gaming is a hit driven business.
    5. A lot of the obvious VR tools are being developed by incumbents (e.g. Oculus Medium, Tiltbrush).
    6. Incumbents have other income streams, so they can invest.  Competing directly with something that's in the wheelhouse of a company like Facebook or Google is a huge mistake -- they have the resources to do a good job while the market is developing.  A company like Altspace VR is FUCKED, since they have to maintain feature parity with FB/Oculus with a team that's 5% the size.
    7. Mobile VR engagement numbers are murky.
    8. VR as a fad.


Why its not that bad:

    1. Incumbents seem bent on copying past successes, and avoiding mistakes of the past.  Lots of focus is on social, chat apps, and games.  Lots of focus on owning the entire stack.  Maybe they're missing something?
    2. Unclear that the app store model is the best way to deliver value to people.
    3. WebVr is a dark horse.
    4. Skilled team can create value quickly.
    5.


So, here's what a VR focused startup must do:

    1. Like all startups, principles apply: dominate a niche.
    2. Avoid games, unless you're really, really, good at both the game making and the marketing side.  If not, luck works.

Opportunities for Startups in VR

A startup is, ideally, geared toward growing quickly and eventually becoming a massive company.  However, at the very least, a startup is an entity that is in complete control of its own destiny, primarily because it does something that nobody else can.  Based on this, it's not clear, to me, where such startup opportunities lie in the VR space right now.

Reasons for this:
1. For strategic reasons, the incumbents are hogging all the innovation opportunities in hardware.
2. Maturing tools mean that it's really easy for ANYONE to build a VR app.
3. VR software distribution mechanisms are basically identical to those on mobile phones, so the economics are going to be similar.

Currently, almost all of the VR hardware innovation opportunities are being driven by big, incumbent, companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and Sony.  Startups have driven some innovation on the hardware side in the past -- Oculus is the most famous and obvious example.  Meta and MagicLeap are startups working on AR hardware.  The HTC/Valve partnership is sort of an odd fit, in that neither company can be considered "large" on a revenue basis.  However, Valve is so dominant on PC gaming I would suggest that they are an incumbent too.  

I think the days of startups having any influence on the core platform are behind us.  The incumbent VR companies have learned a great deal from the winners of the mobile phone wars.  They've realized that key to "winning" is controlling the entire stack, from hardware through to the OS and the APIs that developers use to build apps, and the mechanisms to distribute apps.  This is exactly how Oculus has structured its operations.  For a startup to compete here, it'll need to build its own hardware and software stack.  That's a tall order for a startup -- there's an incredible amount of work to do even to get feature parity with the incumbents.  So why bother even competing here?

A startup can always specialize, by building hardware peripherals, but this means they are dependent on the platform owners standards, APIs, etc.  Oculus will likely force peripheral makers to get licensed first in much the same way Nintendo does, or Microsoft does for Xbox.

The opportunities for startups are in software, but there are limitations here, too.  The mobile phone ecosystem provides a really useful analogy here.  No big software startups got built on top of the mobile app store.  The biggest pure software companies on the mobile app store are, again, the incumbents (Google, Facebook).  The only other successes were game companies, like King.com and Supercell.  Supercell is worth a couple of Billion, to be sure, but its a fraction of a size of a company like Uber.  The companies that benefited most from the app store distribution model are the distribution channel owners: Google and Apple.

(These companies are distinct from Uber, Lyft, food delivery apps, like Instacart, and the like.  There's a distinction between Uber, who merely uses the mobile wave, and Supercell, who specifically makes mobile phone games.  To put it another way, if there's a massive platform shift in five years, and we're all using AR glasses insteand of mobile phones, Uber will still work with few changes, but Supercell will be completely fucked).

VR is unique in that a lot of the software infrastructure built up to support mobile game development also turns out to be incredibly useful for VR.  2012 is really the year Unity came of age, and before then, games and graphical apps were incredibly hard to build.  You basically had to build everything from scratch (I know because I went through it!).  Unity is useful in that you can very quickly, in a couple of hours at most, put together an app that will work on all the different VR platforms.

This puts Unity (and to a lesser extent, Unreal) in an extremely powerful position when it comes to VR.  Unity means you don't need an expensive engine development team, and allows companies to release graphically advanced applications with a mere fraction of the skill required to do so in the past.

From a startup's point of view, if any javascript hacker with a laptop and an internet connection can build an impressive-looking VR app, where do you get your 10x advantage?

So here's a hypothesis: to succeed in VR you don't actually have to be that good at developing VR apps.  You merely have to be competent at it; the 10x advantage needs to come from somewhere else.

To give an example, VR is often touted as the next big thing in education (as is always the case when a new computing platform comes around).  However, I think a company like Clever, or Udacity, is actually in a much stronger position for VR than a company building a VR-specific education app.
